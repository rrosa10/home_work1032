      <h2>Kaladin Stormblessed is the main character in Brandon Sanderson's epic fantasy series, "The Stormlight Archive." Kal is a skilled and resilient warrior who carries the burdens of his past. Born into a lower-class family, even though his father is a surgeon. He joins the military as a surgeon apprentice to protect his wrongfully drafted younger brother. There he rises to become a talented spearman and a natural leader. Kal's journey is filled with personal tragedy and adversity, which only strengthens his determination to protect anyone who needs protection. Kal at one point hits rock bottom multiple times and even though most would have given up he kept on going. I am drawn to characters who have gone through hell and back and just keep going.</h2>
